Check the ports listening on Machine: 

sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
sudo ss -tunlp
sudo lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
sudo lsof -i | grep LISTEN


Where,

-t : All TCP ports
-u : All UDP ports
-l : Display listening server sockets
-p : Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
-n : Don�t resolve names

To find if particular package is installed:

On Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint:
dpkg -l | grep packagename
dpkg -s packagename
dpkg-query -l packagename
which packagename

On Fedora / RHEL / CentOS / Scientific Linux:

rpm -qa | grep packagename




netcat:

1. Netcat can be used for port scanning: to know which ports are open and running services on a target machine. It can scan a single or multiple or a range of open ports.

$ nc -v -w 2 z 192.168.56.1 22     #scan a single port
OR
$ nc -v -w 2 z 192.168.56.1 22 80  #scan multiple ports
OR
$ nc -v -w 2 z 192.168.56.1 20-25  #scan range of ports

2. Netcat allows you to transfer files between two Linux computers or servers and both these systems must have nc installed.

3. You can also use Netcat to create a simple command-line messaging server instantly.

4. Wit the -l option of nc command used to create a basic, insecure web server to serve static web files for learning purposes.

5. Another useful usage of Netcat is to troubleshoot server connection issues. Here, you can use Netcat to verify what data a server is sending in response to commands issued by the client.


find:

The Linux Find Command is one of the most important and frequently used command command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems. Find command is used to search and locate the list of files and directories based on conditions you specify for files that match the arguments.

Find can be used in a variety of conditions like you can find files by permissions, users, groups, file type, date, size, and other possible criteria.

- find / -iname test.txt

finds the root directory for test.txt file -i is for ignore case i.e it will search for test.txt or Test.txt

- find / -type d -name tomcat

finds the root directory for directory type with name tomcat

- find . -type f -perm 0777 -print

finds all the files whose permissions are 777

- find . -type f -name "test.txt" -exec rm -f {} \;

To find a single file called test.txt and remove it.

- find /tmp -type f -empty

To find all empty files under a certain path.

- find /home -user test

To find all files that belong to user test under /home directory.

- find / -mtime 50

To find all the files which are modified 50 days back.
m for modified
a for accessed 
c for changed

- find / -cmin -60

To find all the files which are changed in the last 1 hour

- find / -size +50M -size -100M

To find all the files which are greater than 50MB and less than 100MB.



df:

The �df� command stands for �disk filesystem�, it is used to get a full summary of available and used disk space usage of the file system on Linux system.

Using �-h� parameter with (df -h) will show the file system disk space statistics in �human readable� format, means it gives the details in bytes, megabytes, and gigabyte.

df -m  To display information of all file system usage in MB (Mega Byte) 
df -k To display all file system information and usage in 1024-byte blocks
df -hT /home To see the information of only device /home file system in human readable format
df -h To display information of all file system statistics in GB 
df -i Using �-i� switch will display the information of number of used inodes and their percentage for the file system.
df -T To check the file system type of your system

du:

The Linux du (Disk Usage) is a standard Unix/Linux command, used to check the information of disk usage of files and directories on a machine. The du command has many parameter options that can be used to get the results in many formats. The du command also displays the files and directory sizes in a recursively manner.

du /home To find out the disk usage summary of a /home/tecmint directory tree and each of its sub directories.
du -h /home Using �-h� option with �du� command provides results in �Human Readable Format�. Means you can see sizes in Bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes etc.
du -sh /home To get the summary of a grand total disk usage size of an directory use the option �-s�
du -ah /home Using �-a� flag along with �-h� displays disk usage of all files and folders in human readeable format. The below output is more easy to understand as it shows the files in Kilobytes, Megabytes etc.
du -mh /home To get the summary of disk usage of directory tree along with its subtrees in Megabytes (MB) only. Use the option �-mh� as follows. The �-m� flag counts the blocks in MB units and �-h� stands for human readable format.
du -ah --exclude="*.txt" /home command calculates and displays the disk usage of all files and directories, but excludes the files that matches given pattern. The command excludes the �.txt� files while calculating the total size of diretory. So, this way you can exclude any file formats by using flag �-�exclude�.
