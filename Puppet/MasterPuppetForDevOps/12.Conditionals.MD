## Controlling Flow
- Assignment conditionals
  - Selectors
- Flow conditionals
  - Case statements 
  - If/Else

### Selectors
- Selectors assign data based on an evaluation
- They do not control the flow of code

Example: 
```sh
$package_name = $::facts['os']['family'] ? {
    'Debian' => 'apache2',
    'Redhat' => 'https',
    'Solaris' => 'CSWApache2',
    default => 'httpd',
}
```
### Case Statements
- Case statements execute a block of code depending on the evaluation
```sh
case $::facts['os']['family'] {
  'Redhat' : {
    include yum
  }
  'Debian' : {
    include apt
  }
  default: {
    fail ('Unknown Operating system')
  }
}

```

## If/Else Blocks
- If/else/elsif blocks are used to control the general flow of code
- The block is executed if the evaluation is true
```sh
if $install_package {
    package { $packagename: 
      ensure => installed,
    }
}
```

- If statements support operators to compare two values
```sh
if $environment == 'dev' {
    include devutils
}
```
- If statements support operators to compare two values
  - == equals to 
  - != not equal to 
  - < less than
  - <= less than or equal to
  - > greater than
  - >= greater than or equal to
  - =~ match regular expression

  ## Unless
  - An if statement can be inverted using the unless keyword

  Example: 
  ```sh
  if $environment != 'dev' {
    include users::prod
  }

  unless $environment == 'dev' {
    include users::prod
  }
  ```
